                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">I wanted to be a professional gymnast 🤸🏻‍♀️. I trained for 5 hours per day after school and competed every weekend in the group and individual state competitions (It was really hard 😭). However, due to an injury, I had to leave the competition 😢.
                           <br><br>
                           Thanks to the hard training sessions and the teamwork 🤝, I learned to work hard to pursue and achieve a result to become seventh of Catalonia ✌️. Due to the injury, I learned never to give up 🙌. Despite obstacles, there is always a plan b 😊.

                              For this reason, I started to learn some Corean 🇰🇷 for myself. I also joined art classes 👩🏻‍🎨, started editing videos 🎬, and create animations effects, study design basics, took and edit photos 📷, dance, play volleyball 🏐, play the piano 🎹, and learn how to cook many kinds of dishes 👩🏻‍🍳.
                              <br><br>
                              I really in loved with everything. 😍

                           <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">I started to study Digital Product Design & Graphic Design at <a class="links" href="https://www.eina.cat" target="_blank">Eina, (University of Arts and Design of Barcelona)</a> where I was able to improve my creative skills  💭.

                           <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s"> Through the third year of the University, I participated in an International Contest (in collaboration with the company <a class="links" href="https://www.gamesolution.ch/" target="_blank">Game Solution Asia</a>), in the <a class="links" href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/entrepreneur-of-the-year-us" target="_blank">Entrepreneur of the Year Contest by EY</a>.
                              <br><br>
                              I won the contest ✌️🏆 (I could'nt believe it! I won it!!) 😱. I had the opportunity to work for <a class="links" href="https://www.michaelkors.cn/" target="_blank">Michael Kors</a> and <a class="links" href="https://www.cartier.cn/" target="_blank">Cartier</a> as UX/UI & digital designer in Shanghai for three months 🤩. It was an exciting experience. I was alone in a different country with a language that I didn't talk 🤯. Nevertheless, I learned a lot of Chinese 🇨🇳, and I could improve the English level 🇺🇸.

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">Finally, finished the Degree 🎓, due to the unfavorable employment situation (not everything is so easy 😭), I decided to start working as a freelance while I was actively seeking an opportunity job because I hate to do nothing 💪.
                           <br><br>
                           I could lead projects from scratch, the idea 🤔, or concept 💡, to the development. Helping entrepreneurs and small businesses 🤝 to design their identities and websites, improving their user experience and advisors to succeed in the digital world 🚀.
                           <br><br>
                           With patience, in October of 2019, I started my adventure at <a class="links" href="http://memondonetwork.es/" target="_blank">Memondo Network</a> 🙌 as a UX/UI and Web designer,  where I had the opportunity to manage the digital department and the social network as Creative Content with <a class="links" href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank">AR technology</a> through JavaScript concept 🤓.

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">Due to the pandemic 😭, in May of 2020, my contract was closed 😢, but I didn't give up 💪. I started to work as a freelance again while seeking another job opportunity & improving my skills with online courses at <a class="links" href="https://www.neoland.es" target="_blank">Neoland</a>, or <a class="links" href="https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/activate" target="_blank">Google</a>.
                           <br><br>
                           In June, I had the pleasure to work in collaboration with <a class="links" href="https://www.piaotiandi.cn/home/" target="_blank">Piaotiandi</a> and <a class="links" href="https://www.everis.com/spain/es/home-spain" target="_blank">Everis</a> developer's team on an international project. As a result of working near them, I became more interested in the development and the potential that it has 🤩.
                           <br><br>
                           So I started the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at <a class="links" href="https://www.ironhack.com/es" target="_blank">IronHack</a> 🚀 to leverage my skills to learn something new that makes me a more powerful designer and developer. 
                           <br><br>
                           For that reason, I continued studying and learning new technologies such as TypeScript, Hooks, Data Visualization, GSAP and blogging design stuff to make a career in this world 💪.

                           Just on the last day of the year, when I already believed that they would not hire me due to the pandemic 🥺. I received a huge surprise 🤩. I joined <a class="links" href="http://www.einatec.com/" target="_blank">Einatec Consulting</a> 🙌  as a Unicorn & UX/UI engineer 🦄 (a hybrid profile between design and code).
                           <br><br>
                           I was really excited to start a new path and to be able to develop in my professional career 🚀.
                           <br><br>
                           At the end of January, I had another surprise 😍. (I think this year will be my year ✨. Maybe it will be that I am from the year of the ox 🐮, I don't know 🤷🏻‍♀️).
Anyway, it turns out that I was accepted to be part of the Young Jury at the annual and international web design and development awards by <a class="links" href="http://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</a> 😍.
